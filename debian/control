Description: General purpose cryptographic library - C++ development
 Crypto++ is library for creating C++ programs which use cryptographic
 algorithms.  The library uses a Pipes & Filters architecture with heavy
 use of templates and abstract base classes.  The cryptographic
 tools include:
  * Authenticated encryption schemes (GCM, CCM, EAX),
  * High speed stream ciphers (Panama, Sosemanuk, Salsa20, XSalsa20),
  * AES and candidates (Rijndael, RC6, MARS, Twofish, Serpent, CAST-256),
  * Other symmetric block ciphers (IDEA, Triple-DES, Camellia, SEED,
    RC5, Blowfish, TEA, XTEA, Skipjack, SHACAL-2),
  * Block cipher modes of operation (ECB, CBC, CTS, CFB, OFB, CTR),
  * Message authentication codes (VMAC, HMAC, CMAC, CBC-MAC, DMAC,
    Two-Track-MAC),
  * Hash functions (SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, Tiger,
    WHIRLPOOL, RIPEMD-128, RIPEMD-256, RIPEMD-160, RIPEMD-320),
  * Public-key cryptography (RSA, DSA, ElGamal, NR, RW, LUC, LUCELG,
    DLIES, ESIGN),
  * Padding schemes for public-key systems (PKCS#1, OAEP, PSS, PSSR,
    EMSA2, EMSA5),
  * Key agreement schemes (DH, MQV, LUCDIF, XTR-DH),
  * Elliptic curve cryptography (ECDSA, ECNR, ECIES, ECDH, ECMQV),
  * Backwards compatibility algorithms (MD2, MD4, MD5, Panama Hash, DES,
    ARC4, SEAL 3.0, WAKE, WAKE-OFB, DESX, RC2, SAFER, 3-WAY, GOST,
    SHARK, CAST-128, Square),
  * Pseudo-random number generators,
 and a whole lot more.  Alternative libraries are libgcrypt and
 nettle.
 .
 This package contains the header files needed for developing using
 the Crypto++ class library and the static library with libtool
 supoport.

 This package includes a utility for benchmarking and using the
 various Crypto++ routines from the command line.  It also includes
 the test vectors for validating both the Crypto++ implementation and
 other implementations of these routines.
